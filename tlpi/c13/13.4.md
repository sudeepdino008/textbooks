`printf` utilised the stdio buffers. Whereas `write` system call has no such user-space buffering, and directly puts the string in kernel buffer cache.  
In case of disk, the `printf` string argument remains cached in stdio buffers, while `write` string argument is put in buffer cache. When the stdio buffer is finally `fflushed`, it is queued up after the existing data. Therefore, it would appear on disk as:
```
I would have written you a shorter letter.
If I had more time, 

```

If the standard output is terminal however, stdio flushes when it encounters a newline character in the string argument. Therefore, the output that appears on the terminal is:
```
If I had more time,
I would have written you a shorter letter.
